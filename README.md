# AAPLStockPricePredictionLSTM
Predicting AAPL Stock Price via an LSTM model

## Description
Learned the theory behind RNN, CNN, and LSTM neural networks in my recent Data Mining class but never had the opportunity to implement them. Merging my interests in economics and data science together, I tried to predict the stock price of AAPL via an LSTM. 

I'd love to chat with anyone on how to improve my data preprocessing or model implementation steps. 

## Getting Started 
Simply download the Jupyter Notebook. Data is from the yfinance module. 

Reach out if you have any suggestions to improve my methodology/code. I'm grateful for any learning opportunity!
